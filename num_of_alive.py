# Given an array of birth and death years, return a year that has the highest number of alive people.
# Assume no one dies before they're one aka death year > birth year
# Ex :
# [[2000,2005],[1990,2005],[2005,2010],[1980,1995]]   return -> 2005

list = [[2000,2005],[1990,2005],[2005,2010],[1980,1995]]
